# Represents a Chord Progression, the smallest cohesive unit that songs are built up of,
#   stored in the database and represented as an array of chord symbols.  Chord progressions
#   are universal objects -- entities shared amongst sections and songs.
# Chord Progressions are stored relative to the key the song or section is in.  As such, they
#   are tasked with the duty of being displayed either in relative form (as roman numerals) or,
#   more often, in the context of a given key (with the appropriate "coloration" -- see SongKey).
# Even though chords are represented as an array of chord symbols, for rendering purposes, they
#   are manipulated as instances of the Chord helper class.
