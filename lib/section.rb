# Represents a section of the song.  Contains a type (chorus, verse, etc.) and a sequence of chord
# progressions that make up the section.  In charge of rendering the progressions into the 
# appropriate key, as given by the song it is in and the modulation of the call.  Sections are 
# never shared across songs.  Lyrics are also managed here.
