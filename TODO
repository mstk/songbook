- migrate seed.rb to external YAML file
- add support for giving songs "alternative keys" for sometimes playing
- multiple time signatures within song?
- make requiring .js files a helper
- reorganize to be better lol
- internal lyric variations are kinda crazy.  fix this.  maybe make it an array, and keys and lyrics
  don't have to be database objects what the heck.
